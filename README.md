# alpine-composer

## Requirements

For the most part, assume this must be run on Alpine Linux. You can either boot a VM with the alpine-standard image, or it can be run inside an Alpine container

## One-liner Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/ggpwnkthx/alpine-composer.git && alpine-composer/build.sh
```
